## Feature Breakdown
* **API Documentation**
  The backend APIs follow the OpenAPI standard, providing clear and consistent documentation that simplifies frontend integration and third-party development. Django REST Framework and GraphQL are used to offer both RESTful and flexible query-based access to resources, enabling developers to work efficiently with the system.

* **User Authentication**
  Authentication endpoints allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This foundational feature ensures that users and hosts have personalized, authenticated access to the platform’s features.

* **Property Management**
  These endpoints allow hosts to create, update, and manage property listings, while enabling guests to browse available options. It forms the core functionality that facilitates property discovery and listing management.

* **Booking System**
  The booking system handles reservation creation, updates, and lifecycle events like check-ins and check-outs. It enables seamless interaction between guests and hosts, ensuring accurate tracking of availability and booking statuses.

* **Payment Processing**
  Payment endpoints manage financial transactions for bookings, ensuring secure and smooth payment flows. This feature is crucial for monetizing the platform and building trust between users and hosts.

* Review System
  The review system enables users to provide feedback on properties they’ve stayed in, helping build transparency and trust within the community. It also aids future guests in making informed booking decisions.

* Database Optimizations
  By implementing indexing and caching strategies, the backend ensures fast data retrieval and reduces server load. These optimizations enhance overall performance and scalability, especially as the user base and data volume grow.

## API Security
### Security Measures
* **Authentication**
  This can be implemented using JWT Tokens, It ensures that only verified users can access the platform after logging in to prevent unauthorized access. Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms like bcrypt or argon.

* **Authorization**
  This basically ensures that users can only perform actions they are permitted to, It prevents situations where certain users can perform actions on some other user account or to give special privileges to certain user groups like admins.

* **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**
  This limits te number of request from a single IP or user over a period of time using tools like Django Rest Framework's throttle class. This protects the API against brute-fore attacks, API abuse and Denial of Service Attacks.

* **CORS Rules:**
  This define which origin is allowed to access the api, it helps restrict access to just the domains needed for the platform. This prevents against external attacks from other domain, essentially isolating the API from the general public.

* **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
  All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or XSS. It ensures strict data integrity and guards against data corruption, leakage or other form of compromise which could arise from malicious inputs being sent into the database or backend.

* **Secure Session & Token Management:**
  Implements secure session handling, token expiration, and refresh mechanisms. This reduces the risk of session hijacking and token theft, keeping authenticated sessions safe from attackers.

* **HTTPS & SSL Enforcement:**
  All communications between clients and the backend are encrypted using HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that sensitive information like login credentials or payment tokens is transmitted securely.

* **Secure Payment Handling:**
  Integrates with PCI-compliant third-party payment gateways like Stripe or Paystack and avoids storing sensitive card data directly on the server. This protects users' financial information and ensures compliance with global data protection regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR.

* **Logging and Audit Trails:**
  All important operations like login attempts, payment actions, data updates are logged and monitored. This enables detection and analysis of suspicious behavior, aiding in incident response and regulatory compliance.
  
### Reasoning behind Security
* **Protecting User Data:**
  Security ensures personal information such as emails, property address, passwords and many more sensitive information is not exposed or stolen. This protects user privacy and prevents identity theft or account hijacking.

* **Securing Payments:**
  Strong security is essential to protect user financial transactions and prevent fraud. A compromised payment system could lead to stolen credit card details, or payment manipulation which eventually leads to losses in the business.

* **Safeguarding Property Listings:**
  Only authorized users should be able to create, update, or delete their listings. Without proper security, malicious users could alter or delete property data, leading to loss of income and credibility.

* **Preventing Booking Abuse**
  Security ensures that only legitimate users can make and modify bookings. This prevents fake reservations, double bookings, or manipulation of availability calendars.

* **Ensuring Review Integrity**
  Authentication and validation protect the review system from spam, fake reviews, or review bombing, maintaining fairness and trust across the platform.

* **Maintaining Platform Availability:**
  Rate limiting, throttling, and input validation protect against attacks like DoS, brute force, or injection, which can take the platform offline or corrupt data.
    
## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD means **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**, CI/CD pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. Whenever there is an update to the codebase, CI/CD ensures the application is automatically tested and deployed to the appropriate environment, reducing manual work and the risk of errors.

In this project CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, enable faster development cycles, and ensure reliable deployments. This is critical for delivering new features, fixing bugs, and scaling the platform without downtime or regressions, especially when multiple developers are contributing.

### CI/CD Tools
