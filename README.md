# airbnb-clone-project

  ## Objective
  The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

  ## Project Goals
  1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
  3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
  4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
  5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

  ## Team Roles
    * **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
    * **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
    * **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
    * **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

  ## Technology Stack
    - **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
    - **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
    - **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
    - **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
    - **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
    - **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
    - **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
    - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

  ## Database Design
    ### Tables
      - **Users:**
        * id
        * name
        * email
      - **Properties:**
        * user_id
        * name
        * address
        * status (Booked / Free)
        * price
      - **Bookings:**
        * user_id
        * property_id
        * start_date
        * end_date
      - **Reviews:**
        * user_id
        * property_id
        * comment
        * rating
      - **Payments:**
        * booking_id
        * user_id
        * method
        * status
    
    ### Relationships
      - Users can have many Properties
      - User can book for a Property
      - Bookings are related to one Property
      - Properties can have many reviews
      - User can make reviews on many Properties
      - Reviews can only have one user and one Property
      - Properties can have many bookings but not at the same time
      - Payment is related to one bookings
      - Payment is related to one User

  ## Feature Breakdown
    1. **API Documentation**
      The backend APIs follow the OpenAPI standard, providing clear and consistent documentation that simplifies frontend integration and third-party development. Django REST Framework and GraphQL are used to offer both RESTful and flexible query-based access to resources, enabling developers to work efficiently with the system.

    2. **User Authentication**
      Authentication endpoints allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This foundational feature ensures that users and hosts have personalized, authenticated access to the platform’s features.

    3. **Property Management**
      These endpoints allow hosts to create, update, and manage property listings, while enabling guests to browse available options. It forms the core functionality that facilitates property discovery and listing management.

    4. **Booking System**
      The booking system handles reservation creation, updates, and lifecycle events like check-ins and check-outs. It enables seamless interaction between guests and hosts, ensuring accurate tracking of availability and booking statuses.

    5. **Payment Processing**
      Payment endpoints manage financial transactions for bookings, ensuring secure and smooth payment flows. This feature is crucial for monetizing the platform and building trust between users and hosts.

    6. Review System
      The review system enables users to provide feedback on properties they’ve stayed in, helping build transparency and trust within the community. It also aids future guests in making informed booking decisions.

    7. Database Optimizations
      By implementing indexing and caching strategies, the backend ensures fast data retrieval and reduces server load. These optimizations enhance overall performance and scalability, especially as the user base and data volume grow.
